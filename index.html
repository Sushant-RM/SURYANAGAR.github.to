        <h2>Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            The course **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** delves into the principles behind efficient algorithm design and the methods to analyze their complexities. 
            It covers advanced data structures and algorithmic paradigms like **divide and conquer**, **dynamic programming**, **greedy algorithms**, and **graph algorithms**.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this course, we studied essential data structures like **linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, and hash tables**, and we explored algorithms 
            for sorting, searching, shortest paths, and spanning trees. By understanding the computational trade-offs, we have learned to design solutions 
            for real-world problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Connecting the Course to Real-World Applications</h3>
        <p>
            Algorithms are integral to modern technology, whether it's optimizing delivery routes, securing data through encryption, or building recommendation systems.
            The techniques learned in this course are applied in areas such as **urban planning**, **healthcare** optimization, and **financial analytics**. 
            For example, algorithms for graph traversal can be used to model traffic flow in a Smart City.
