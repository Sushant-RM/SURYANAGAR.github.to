        <section id="geospatial-digital-twin">
    <h2>Geospatial Mapping, Digital Twin, and Citizen Feedback in Smart Cities</h2>
    <p>To support SDG 11, smart cities utilize various technologies like geospatial mapping, digital twins, and participatory planning to enhance urban governance. Below, we provide simplified explanations of these concepts:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Geospatial Mapping (GIS Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tracks different areas (residential, commercial, industrial) in a city.</p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Adds land use zones with details like type and area, displaying all zones and their information.</p>

    <h3>2. Digital Twin (DigitalTwin Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Creates a virtual city model to simulate problems like traffic or urban sprawl.</p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Simulates scenarios and suggests solutions (like fixing traffic or adding parks), displaying the virtual city model.</p>

    <h3>3. Participatory Planning (ParticipatoryPlanning Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Collects feedback from citizens about city improvements.</p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Stores feedback from citizens (like what they think the city needs), displaying feedback sorted alphabetically by citizen names.</p>

    <h3>4. Urban Planning System (UrbanPlanningSystem Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Connects all the components to make decisions for better urban planning.</p>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Sets up the GIS with land use zones.</li>
            <li>Creates and displays the digital twin model.</li>
            <li>Simulates city scenarios like traffic or urban sprawl.</li>
            <li>Collects and displays citizen feedback.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Main Function:</strong> Runs the program, showing how the system works step by step.</p>

    <p>In summary, this program helps simulate city planning using tools like GIS, virtual models, and citizen feedback to make better decisions about urban growth.</p>

    <h2>Urban Planning Algorithms for Smart Cities</h2>
    <p>This section outlines how different algorithms are used for urban planning, addressing air quality monitoring, climate resilience, waste management, and waste collection:</p>

    <h3>1. Air Quality Monitoring using Hashing</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Stores and retrieves air quality data efficiently using an unordered_map.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The `add_data` method adds region-specific air quality data, while `get_data` retrieves it.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Climate Resilience Planning using Union-Find</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Manages connected regions efficiently using Union-Find with path compression and union by rank.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> `union_sets` connects regions, and `find` checks connectivity.</p>

    <h3>3. Waste Management using Segment Tree</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Efficiently handles range queries and updates on waste levels.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The `build` method constructs the tree, `query` retrieves range sums, and `update` modifies values.</p>

    <h3>4. Waste Collection using DFS</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Traverses connected zones using DFS to optimize waste collection paths.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> `add_edge` connects zones, and `dfs` explores connected components.</p>

    <p><strong>Main Flow:</strong> The system starts with Air Quality Monitoring using hashing, then moves to Climate Resilience with Union-Find, Waste Management with Segment Trees, and Waste Collection using DFS.</p>

    <p>This approach demonstrates how these algorithms are applied to address urban planning challenges in smart cities.</p>

    <h2>Additional Algorithms for Smart Cities</h2>
    <p>This section provides explanations of some essential algorithms used in smart city applications:</p>

    <h3>1. Dijkstra's Algorithm for Smart Transportation</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Finds the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The algorithm processes nodes based on their current shortest known distance and uses a priority queue to prioritize nodes with the smallest distance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `dijkstra.find_shortest_path(0, graph)` finds shortest paths from node 0.</p>

    <h3>2. Segment Tree for Energy Consumption</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Efficiently handles range queries and updates on energy consumption data.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The `build` method constructs the tree, `query` retrieves sum over a range, and `update` modifies a value.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `energy_tree.query(1, 3)` calculates the sum of energy consumption from zones 1 to 3. `energy_tree.update(2, 100)` updates the energy value at position 2.</p>

    <h3>3. Union-Find for Green Infrastructure</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Helps track connected components efficiently.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The `find` method returns the root of a node, while `union_sets` merges two sets.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `uf.find(0) == uf.find(4)` checks if two parks are connected.</p>

    <p><strong>Main Flow:</strong> The system follows a structured flow: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in transportation, Segment Tree for energy consumption, and Union-Find for managing connected components in green infrastructure.</p>

    <p>This combination of algorithms helps enhance urban planning, transportation, and infrastructure efficiency in smart cities.</p>

    <p>This section explains how different algorithms are applied to crisis management in smart cities:</p>

    <h3>1. Early Warning System</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Represents IoT-enabled sensors for detecting crises like floods or earthquakes.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Each sensor checks if its reading exceeds predefined thresholds, triggering alerts if a crisis is detected.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `Sensor(1, 8.0, "Flood")` triggers an alert since the reading exceeds the flood threshold.</p>

    <h3>2. Crisis Mapping</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Represents a city grid where crisis areas are marked with levels.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> `update_grid` updates crisis locations on the grid, while `display_map` shows the current crisis map.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `cityMap.update_grid(2, 2, 5)` marks a flood area at coordinates (2, 2) with a crisis level of 5.</p>

    <h3>3. Resilience Dashboard</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tracks resilience metrics like response time, infrastructure health, and readiness.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> `update_metric` adds or updates these metrics.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `dashboard.update_metric("Disaster Response Time", 2.5)` records the response time.</p>

    <h3>4. Union-Find for Green Infrastructure</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tracks connected components efficiently, useful in crisis mapping.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> `union_sets` connects areas in the grid for efficient grouping of crisis-affected regions.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `uf.union_sets(2, 12)` connects area 2 and area 12.</p>

    <h3>5. Dijkstra's Algorithm for Resource Allocation</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Finds shortest paths from a resource center to crisis areas using a graph representation.</p>
    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> The algorithm processes nodes based on their current shortest known distance and uses a priority queue for efficiency.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> `dijkstra.find_shortest_path(0, graph)` calculates shortest distances from node 0 to other nodes.</p>

    <p><strong>Main Flow:</strong> The system utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculations, Union-Find for managing connected crisis regions, Crisis Mapping for grid-based data, Early Warning Systems with IoT sensors, and a Resilience Dashboard to track metrics.</p>

    <p>This combination of algorithms helps improve crisis management and resource allocation in smart cities.</p>
