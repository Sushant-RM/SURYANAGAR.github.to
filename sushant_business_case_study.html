            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Digital governance in smart cities helps improve urban management, increase citizen participation, and promote sustainability. It supports SDG 11 by making cities more inclusive, safe, and resilient through technology.</p>

            <h2>SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>
            <h3>Target 11.3: Improve city planning with input from citizens</h3>
            <p><strong>Indicator 11.3.2:</strong> Percentage of cities where people have a say in how things are run.</p>
            <p>Digital governance tools, like apps and websites, allow residents to report issues (e.g., potholes, broken streetlights), share ideas, and vote on city projects, making urban planning more participatory and democratic.</p>
            <p>These tools also help governments be more transparent by showing real-time information about city services and resources, building trust with residents.</p>
            <p>Additionally, technology like data analytics and optimization algorithms (e.g., Kruskal's Algorithm) helps cities plan better, save money, and improve resource use, such as optimizing public transport routes or utility systems.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="algorithms">
            <h2>How Algorithms Help in SDG 11</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Kruskal's Algorithm: Optimizing Urban Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>Kruskal's Algorithm is useful for connecting different parts of the city in the most cost-effective way, such as optimizing public transportation routes or utility networks. By minimizing the costs, cities can improve their infrastructure and reduce expenses.</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">Kruskal's:</span>

            </p>

            <h3>2. Dijkstra's Algorithm: Optimizing Public Transport Routes</h3>
            <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm helps in finding the shortest and most efficient routes for public transportation. By using real-time data, cities like Singapore optimize their transport systems to reduce congestion and improve travel times for residents.</p>

            </p>

            <h3>3. Merge Sort: Sorting Public Feedback and Data</h3>
            <p>Merge Sort helps in sorting large amounts of data, such as citizen feedback or public service data. In cities like Tallinn, Merge Sort ensures that citizen feedback is processed efficiently, making public service delivery more transparent and accountable.</p>

        <section id="examples">
            <h2>Examples of Digital Governance in SDG 11</h2>
            <h3>1. Barcelona</h3>
            <p>In Barcelona, the Decidim platform allows residents to vote on local projects and share their opinions, helping make city planning more inclusive.</p>
            <h3>2. Curitiba</h3>
            <p>Curitiba uses smart waste management systems with sensors to monitor garbage levels, ensuring efficient use of resources and a cleaner city.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Digital governance is crucial in achieving SDG 11, as it empowers citizens, enhances transparency, and optimizes city management. With these tools, cities can become more inclusive, sustainable, and efficient for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Geospatial Mapping, Digital Twin, and Citizen Feedback in Smart Cities</h2>
    <p>To support SDG 11, smart cities utilize various technologies like geospatial mapping, digital twins, and participatory planning to enhance urban governance. Below, we provide simplified explanations of these concepts:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Geospatial Mapping (GIS Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Tracks different areas (residential, commercial, industrial) in a city.</p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Adds land use zones with details like type and area, displaying all zones and their information.</p>

    <h3>2. Digital Twin (DigitalTwin Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Creates a virtual city model to simulate problems like traffic or urban sprawl.</p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Simulates scenarios and suggests solutions (like fixing traffic or adding parks), displaying the virtual city model.</p>

    <h3>3. Participatory Planning (ParticipatoryPlanning Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Collects feedback from citizens about city improvements.</p>
    <p><strong>Features:</strong> Stores feedback from citizens (like what they think the city needs), displaying feedback sorted alphabetically by citizen names.</p>

    <h3>4. Urban Planning System (UrbanPlanningSystem Class)</h3>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Connects all the components to make decisions for better urban planning.</p>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>Sets up the GIS with land use zones.</li>
            <li>Creates and displays the digital twin model.</li>
            <li>Simulates city scenarios like traffic or urban sprawl.</li>
            <li>Collects and displays citizen feedback.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Main Function:</strong> Runs the program, showing how the system works step by step.</p>

    <p>In summary, this program helps simulate city planning using tools like GIS, virtual models, and citizen feedback to make better decisions about urban growth.</p>
