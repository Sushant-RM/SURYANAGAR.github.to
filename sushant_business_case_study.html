            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Digital governance in smart cities leverages technology to improve urban management, enhance citizen participation, and ensure sustainable development. This case study explores the role of digital governance in achieving specific UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By integrating modern tools like data analytics, online platforms, and IoT devices, cities can manage resources better and offer services more efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Relevant SDGs</h2>
            <h3>1. SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target 11.3:</strong> Enhance participatory urban planning and management.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicator 11.3.2:</strong> Proportion of cities with democratic participation in urban management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Smart cities use apps and websites to allow residents to report issues like potholes or broken streetlights, making urban management collaborative and transparent.</p>
            <h3>2. SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target 16.6:</strong> Develop transparent and accountable institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicator 16.10.2:</strong> Guarantee public access to information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Open data portals and dashboards give citizens real-time access to information, promoting trust in government institutions.</p>
            <h3>3. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target 9.C:</strong> Increase access to ICT and digital solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicator 9.C.1:</strong> Proportion of population covered by mobile networks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Expanding Wi-Fi coverage and providing affordable internet ensure that more people can benefit from digital governance tools.</p>

        <section id="examples">
            <h2>Case Examples</h2>
            <h3>1. Barcelona, Spain</h3>
            <p>Barcelona uses a smart city platform called "Decidim" where residents can participate in policy-making and vote on local issues. This aligns with SDG 11.3, fostering inclusive urban planning.</p>
            <h3>2. Tallinn, Estonia</h3>
            <p>Tallinn's e-Governance system ensures transparent public service delivery by enabling citizens to access over 99% of services online. This supports SDG 16.6 for transparent institutions.</p>
            <h3>3. Singapore</h3>
            <p>Singapore leverages its Smart Nation initiative to use real-time data for urban planning. For instance, sensors monitor traffic congestion, which helps optimize public transportation and reduces commute times, addressing SDG 9.</p>
            <h3>4. Curitiba, Brazil</h3>
            <p>Curitiba introduced a smart waste management system where sensors in garbage bins inform the city when they need to be emptied. This efficient use of resources promotes sustainability under SDG 11.</p>

    <h2>Relevant SDGs</h2>
    <h3>1. SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target 11.3:</strong> Enhance participatory urban planning and management.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 11.3.2:</strong> Proportion of cities with democratic participation in urban management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Smart cities use apps and websites to allow residents to report issues like potholes or broken streetlights, making urban management collaborative and transparent. **Kruskal's Algorithm** can optimize urban infrastructure by minimizing the cost of connecting different parts of the city (e.g., public transport routes, utility networks).</p>
    
    <h3>2. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target 9.C:</strong> Increase access to ICT and digital solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 9.C.1:</strong> Proportion of population covered by mobile networks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Expanding Wi-Fi coverage and providing affordable internet ensures more people benefit from digital governance tools. Dijkstra's Algorithm is used in optimizing public transport routes by finding the shortest and most efficient paths, reducing congestion and improving travel times in cities like **Singapore**.</p>
    <p>Dijkstra's Code:<a href="dijkstra.cpp" target="_blank" class="button"></a></p>
    
    <h3>3. SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target 16.6:</strong> Develop transparent and accountable institutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Indicator 16.10.2:</strong> Guarantee public access to information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Open data portals and dashboards give citizens real-time access to information, promoting trust in government institutions. **Merge Sort** helps in sorting citizen feedback and public service data efficiently, ensuring transparent and accountable governance, as seen in **Tallinn, Estonia**.</p>
