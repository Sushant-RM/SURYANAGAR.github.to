        <h1>Home Page – Course Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</strong> course! This course is all about learning how to solve problems in smart and efficient ways. It teaches you how to create step-by-step instructions (called algorithms) to solve problems and how to figure out which solution works best. It’s like learning the science behind problem-solving for computers!</p>

        <h2>What is the course about?</h2>
        <p>This course helps you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn different strategies to solve problems, like breaking them into smaller parts (<em>divide-and-conquer</em>) or making decisions step-by-step (<em>greedy methods</em>).</li>
            <li>Understand how to measure how "fast" or "efficient" a solution is by analyzing how much time and memory it uses.</li>
            <li>Use special tools (called data structures) to store and organize data, making it easier and faster to solve problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By the end, you’ll be able to handle complex problems and create solutions that are not only correct but also quick and efficient!</p>

        <h2>What kind of data structures and algorithms have you studied?</h2>
        <p>We’ve explored different tools and techniques, such as:</p>

        <h3>Data Structures (How we organize and store data):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrays and Linked Lists:</strong> Simple ways to store and access items like numbers or names.</li>
            <li><strong>Stacks and Queues:</strong> Useful for tasks like "undo" in apps or managing waiting lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Trees:</strong> Used to organize things like family trees or folder structures on your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> Help us understand networks, like social connections or roads on a map.</li>
            <li><strong>Hash Tables:</strong> A super-fast way to look things up, like finding a contact in your phone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Algorithms (How we solve problems):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sorting and Searching:</strong> Like arranging a deck of cards or finding a specific book in a library.</li>
            <li><strong>Shortest Path:</strong> Figuring out the fastest way to get from one place to another (think Google Maps).</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Solving tricky problems by remembering solutions to smaller parts of the problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Greedy Methods:</strong> Making the best choice step-by-step to solve problems, like picking coins for change.</li>
            <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Trying different options until you find the right solution, like solving a Sudoku puzzle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How does this course connect to real life?</h2>
        <p>The things we learn here are used in everyday life and technology:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding Directions:</strong> Algorithms help GPS apps like Google Maps find the fastest route.</li>
            <li><strong>File Compression:</strong> Techniques from this course are used to compress files into ZIP or MP3 formats.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Graph algorithms help platforms like Facebook suggest friends or recommend posts.</li>
            <li><strong>Online Shopping:</strong> Algorithms decide what items to recommend to you based on your browsing.</li>
            <li><strong>Games:</strong> Backtracking and AI help in creating smarter opponents and better strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Algorithms are used to organize work schedules or plan deliveries efficiently.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This course shows us how the digital world works behind the scenes and equips us with the tools to solve problems that impact the real world. Whether you’re coding apps, solving puzzles, or optimizing tasks, the skills from this course will come in handy!</p>
